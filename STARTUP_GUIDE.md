# üöÄ Soccer Referee Bias Analysis Platform - Startup Guide

## Overview
This platform analyzes referee bias in soccer matches and provides sophisticated match predictions using **Machine Learning algorithms**. It consists of a React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database, and trained ML models for match prediction.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

```
Frontend (React) ‚Üê‚Üí Backend (FastAPI) ‚Üê‚Üí Database (MongoDB)
     :3000              :8001              :27017

```

## üìã Prerequisites

- Docker environment (already provided in this setup)
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB
- Scikit-learn for ML models

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Check Service Status
```bash
sudo supervisorctl status
```
All services should show `RUNNING`:
- backend
- frontend  
- mongodb

### 2. Restart Services (if needed)
```bash
# Restart all services
sudo supervisorctl restart all

# Or restart individually
sudo supervisorctl restart backend
sudo supervisorctl restart frontend
sudo supervisorctl restart mongodb
```

### 3. Access the Application
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8001
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8001/docs

### 4. Check Service Logs
```bash
# Backend logs
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.*.log

# Frontend logs  
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/frontend.*.log

# MongoDB logs
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/mongodb.*.log
```

## ü§ñ ML Model Setup (First Time Only)

### 1. Check ML Model Status
Navigate to the **Match Prediction** tab in the frontend to check if models are trained.

### 2. Train ML Models (Required on First Run)
```bash
# Via API
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/api/train-ml-models"

# Or use the frontend button "üß† Train ML Models"
```

### 3. Verify Model Training
The system will train 5 models:
- **Classification**: Win/Draw/Loss prediction (~75% accuracy)
- **4 Regression models**: Home/Away goals and xG prediction

Models are saved in `/app/backend/models/` directory.

### 4. Model Management Commands
```bash
# Check model status
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8001/api/ml-models/status"

# Reload models from disk
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/api/ml-models/reload"
```

### Upload Steps

1. **Navigate to Data Upload Tab**
2. **Upload files in this order:**
   - Player Stats first
   - Team Stats second  
   - Match Results last
3. **Wait for processing confirmation**
4. **Calculate comprehensive team stats** (button in Team Performance tab)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Backend Won't Start
```bash
# Check logs
tail -n 50 /var/log/supervisor/backend.*.log

# Common fixes
sudo supervisorctl restart backend
pip install -r /app/backend/requirements.txt

# Check ML model directory
ls -la /app/backend/models/
```

#### ML Models Not Working
```bash
# Check model status
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8001/api/ml-models/status"

# Retrain models if needed
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/api/train-ml-models"

# Check model files exist
ls -la /app/backend/models/*.pkl
```

#### Frontend Build Errors
```bash
# Check logs
tail -n 50 /var/log/supervisor/frontend.*.log

# Common fixes
cd /app/frontend
yarn install
sudo supervisorctl restart frontend
```

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check MongoDB status
sudo supervisorctl status mongodb

# Restart if needed
sudo supervisorctl restart mongodb
```

#### Data Upload Fails
- Verify CSV format matches required columns exactly
- Check for special characters in team/player names
- Ensure match_id consistency across files
- Upload files in correct order (Player ‚Üí Team ‚Üí Match)

#### Prediction Errors
- Ensure ML models are trained (check Match Prediction tab)
- Verify teams and referees exist in database
- Check that sufficient historical data is available
- Retrain models if dataset has changed significantly

### Performance Optimization

#### For Large Datasets
- Upload data in smaller batches
- Monitor memory usage during ML training
- Consider training models overnight for large datasets
- Use model reload instead of retraining for temporary issues

#### ML Model Performance
- Retrain models when adding significant new data
- Monitor model accuracy metrics in training results
- Consider feature selection for improved performance

## üìö Next Steps

1. **Upload your data** following the CSV format guidelines
2. **Train ML models** for match prediction (first time setup)
3. **Explore team performance** to understand your dataset
4. **Calculate RBS scores** for referee bias analysis
5. **Make ML predictions** using the trained models
6. **Optimize referee assignments** using the RBS optimization tool
7. **Monitor model performance** and retrain as needed

## üÜò Support

For technical issues:
1. Check the logs first
2. Verify ML models are trained (Match Prediction tab)
3. Verify data format requirements
4. Ensure all services are running
5. Review this startup guide

### ML-Specific Support
- **Model Training Issues**: Check system memory and available data
- **Prediction Errors**: Verify model status and feature availability
- **Performance Problems**: Consider model retraining or feature selection
