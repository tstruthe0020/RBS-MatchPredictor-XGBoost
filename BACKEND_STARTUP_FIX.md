# Backend Startup Issue Fixed!

## ‚úÖ **Problem Identified and Fixed**

The issue was that the `server.py` file was missing the crucial startup code at the end:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    print("Starting Football Analytics API Server...")
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8001, reload=True)
```

Without this code, Python would load all the modules and classes but never actually start the web server.

## üöÄ **Try Starting Backend Again:**

```bash
cd C:\Users\theos\RBS-MatchPredictor-XGBoost\backend
python server.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Loading XGBoost models...
[sklearn version warning - not critical]
XGBoost models loaded successfully
Starting Football Analytics API Server...
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [xxxxx] using StatReload
INFO:     Started server process [xxxxx]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

## ‚úÖ **After Server Starts Successfully:**

1. **Test Backend**: Open http://localhost:8001/docs in browser
2. **Start Frontend**: In new terminal:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\theos\RBS-MatchPredictor-XGBoost\frontend
   yarn start
   ```
3. **Access Application**: http://localhost:3000

## üìù **Note About sklearn Warning:**
The sklearn version warning is just a compatibility notice. It means the models were trained with sklearn 1.7.0 but you have 1.6.1 installed. This usually works fine, but if you encounter issues later, you can:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn==1.7.0
```

The important thing is that it says "XGBoost models loaded successfully" - that means your models are working!
