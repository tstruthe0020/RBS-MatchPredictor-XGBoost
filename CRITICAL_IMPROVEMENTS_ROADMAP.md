# Football Analytics Suite - Critical Improvements Roadmap

## Priority 1: Immediate Critical Fixes (1-2 weeks)

### 🚨 **Model Accuracy & Validation Issues**

**Problem**: Unrealistic prediction outputs observed (win probabilities >100%, extreme scores)
**Impact**: Core functionality reliability compromised

**Solutions**:
1. **Probability Normalization**:
   ```python
   # Ensure probabilities sum to 100%
   total_prob = home_win + draw + away_win
   normalized_probs = [p / total_prob * 100 for p in [home_win, draw, away_win]]
   ```

2. **Score Prediction Bounds**:
   ```python
   # Realistic score bounds (0-8 goals typical range)
   predicted_home_goals = max(0, min(8, predicted_home_goals))
   predicted_away_goals = max(0, min(8, predicted_away_goals))
   ```

3. **Model Validation Pipeline**:
   - Cross-validation on historical data
   - Backtesting with known results
   - Statistical significance testing
