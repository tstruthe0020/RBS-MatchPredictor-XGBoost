        comment: "Successfully tested the enhanced regression analysis system. The GET /api/regression-stats endpoint now correctly returns 20 available statistics organized into categories (10 basic stats, 9 advanced stats, 1 outcome stat) with comprehensive descriptions. The advanced stats like xg_per_shot, goals_per_xg, shot_accuracy, and conversion_rate are properly included and work correctly in regression analysis. Testing with advanced stats showed a much higher R² score (0.425) compared to basic stats (-0.013), indicating these derived metrics are more predictive of match outcomes."

        comment: "Successfully tested the new config suggestion endpoint. The endpoint correctly performs regression analysis on key statistics and generates meaningful configuration suggestions. The response includes R² score (0.422), sample size (758), and specific recommendations for adjusting weights based on statistical correlations. The suggestions are organized into categories (xg_calculation, adjustments) with explanations and confidence level. The endpoint provides actionable insights that can directly improve the match prediction algorithm's default configuration."
