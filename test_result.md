        comment: "Successfully tested the enhanced regression analysis system. The GET /api/regression-stats endpoint now correctly returns 20 available statistics organized into categories (10 basic stats, 9 advanced stats, 1 outcome stat) with comprehensive descriptions. The advanced stats like xg_per_shot, goals_per_xg, shot_accuracy, and conversion_rate are properly included and work correctly in regression analysis. Testing with advanced stats showed a much higher R² score (0.425) compared to basic stats (-0.013), indicating these derived metrics are more predictive of match outcomes."

        comment: "Successfully tested the new config suggestion endpoint. The endpoint correctly performs regression analysis on key statistics and generates meaningful configuration suggestions. The response includes R² score (0.422), sample size (758), and specific recommendations for adjusting weights based on statistical correlations. The suggestions are organized into categories (xg_calculation, adjustments) with explanations and confidence level. The endpoint provides actionable insights that can directly improve the match prediction algorithm's default configuration."

        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Verified that field mapping issues have been partially resolved. The mapping code is correctly implemented in the server.py file with proper fallbacks and field mappings. The GET /api/team-performance/{team_name} endpoint now correctly maps 'fouls' to 'fouls_committed' and 'possession_pct' to 'possession_percentage', and calculates 'xg_difference' properly. The RBS calculation also uses these mapped fields correctly. However, testing revealed that the actual data for 'fouls_drawn' and 'penalties_awarded' is still zero for all teams, suggesting that while the mapping code is correct, the underlying data may be missing. This is likely due to the data import process rather than a code issue."

    message: "I've tested the field mapping fixes for the statistics that were showing as 0.00 in referee pages. The code changes look good - proper mappings have been implemented for 'fouls_committed', 'possession_percentage', and 'xg_difference'. The RBS calculation is using these fields correctly. However, I found that while the mapping code is correct, the actual data for 'fouls_drawn' and 'penalties_awarded' is still zero for all teams I tested. This suggests the issue might be with the underlying data rather than the code. The field mappings are in place, but there may not be any data for these fields in the database. This would require either updating the data import process or generating synthetic data for these fields."
