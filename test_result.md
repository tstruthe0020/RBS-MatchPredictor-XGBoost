        comment: "Verified that field mapping issues have been partially resolved. The mapping code is correctly implemented in the server.py file with proper fallbacks and field mappings.

The RBS calculation also uses these mapped fields correctly. However, testing revealed that the actual data for 'fouls_drawn' and 'penalties_awarded' is still zero for all teams, suggesting that while the mapping code is correct, the underlying data may be missing. This is likely due to the data import process rather than a code issue."

However, there are still issues: 1) In RBS calculation, fouls_drawn values are zero in the stats breakdown despite being non-zero in team performance, 2) In regression analysis, fouls_drawn and penalties_awarded have zero coefficients.

The xG difference values are different for home vs away games (0.84 home/0.71 away). RBS calculation correctly includes all 7 statistics with non-zero values for xG difference and meaningful possession percentage contributions. Data consistency checks confirm that xG values are properly aggregated from player stats, xG difference is correctly calculated as (team xG - opponent xG), and possession values come from the team_stats possession_pct column. Regression analysis shows that advanced statistics including xG-related metrics provide much better predictive power (R² = 0.425) compared to basic stats (R² = -0.006).
