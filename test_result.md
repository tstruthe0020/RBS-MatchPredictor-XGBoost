    message: "I've tested the enhanced match prediction endpoint with probability fields. The POST /api/predict-match endpoint now correctly includes the new probability fields (home_win_probability, draw_probability, away_win_probability) in the response. Testing with multiple team combinations confirmed that the probabilities are reasonable numbers between 0-100% and sum to exactly 100%. The probabilities are also consistent with the predicted goals - teams with higher predicted goals have higher win probabilities. Testing with different team combinations (Arsenal vs Aston Villa: 22.39%/70.32%/7.29%, Atlanta United vs Austin FC: 61.2%/25.84%/12.96%, Bournemouth vs CF Montr√©al: 9.61%/54.24%/36.15%) showed that the probabilities vary appropriately based on the predicted goals. The existing functionality for predicted goals and xG continues to work correctly alongside the new probability fields."
