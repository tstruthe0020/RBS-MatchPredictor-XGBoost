# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

## user_problem_statement: 
Add a new match prediction algorithm to the Soccer Referee Bias Analysis Platform that predicts match outcomes using detailed statistics from MongoDB. The system should implement Expected xG calculation per team, home/away context adjustments, referee bias integration (RBS scaling where -5 = -1.0 xG), and Points per Game (PPG) calculations. The algorithm should return predicted scoreline with detailed breakdown.

user_problem_statement: "I have implemented a new match prediction algorithm for the Soccer Referee Bias Analysis Platform. Please test the following: 1. Match Prediction Endpoint (POST /api/predict-match) with required fields (home_team, away_team, referee_name) and optional field (match_date). 2. Team Performance Endpoint (GET /api/team-performance/{team_name}) that returns team stats used for predictions."

NEW UPDATE: "Updated RBS calculation logic with new formula. The new RBS formula uses team-level statistics only and calculates per-match averages for yellow_cards, red_cards, fouls_committed, fouls_drawn, penalties_awarded, xg_difference (team xG - opponent xG), and possession_percentage. It applies specific weights, normalizes stat direction, and uses tanh normalization to get RBS scores between -1 and +1. Also added configurable RBS settings similar to match predictor."

Verified that the calculation correctly uses team-level statistics only, calculates xg_difference as (team xG - opponent xG) per match, applies the specified weights, and uses tanh normalization to get RBS scores between -1 and +1. Tested with sample data and confirmed that RBS scores are properly normalized between -1 and +1 (observed values: -0.998, -0.993, 0.973, 0.691, -0.18). The calculation method is properly implemented as async."
