        comment: "Tested the Phase 2 time decay implementation. The GET /api/time-decay/presets endpoint correctly returns all 5 required decay presets (aggressive, moderate, conservative, linear, none) with proper configurations. The aggressive preset uses exponential decay with a 2-month half-life, moderate uses 4-month half-life, and conservative uses 8-month half-life. The linear preset uses a 10% decay rate per month, and the none preset applies no time decay. The time decay calculation functions (calculate_team_averages_with_decay, get_referee_bias_with_decay, get_head_to_head_stats_with_decay, get_team_form_with_decay) are implemented correctly, but could not be fully tested through the API due to a serialization error with NumPy float32 values in the enhanced prediction endpoint. The code review confirms that these functions properly implement time decay weighting based on match dates."

The time decay presets (aggressive, moderate, conservative, linear, none) are correctly implemented and accessible through the API. All presets return successful predictions, though the time decay info is not included in the prediction breakdown. The NumPy serialization fix is partially working - all main numeric fields are properly serialized as Python native types, but some nested fields in the prediction breakdown still have non-serializable types. The ML model integration is working with 45 features, meeting the requirement of 45+ features. Feature importance information is correctly included in the prediction breakdown. The Starting XI functionality exists but could not be fully tested due to lack of player data in the database. The fallback mode for Starting XI is not working properly. Overall, the core enhanced prediction functionality is working, but there are some minor issues with the time decay info display and Starting XI fallback mode."

The Starting XI toggle button works properly, allowing users to enable/disable the Starting XI functionality. The time decay checkbox and settings are also working correctly - when the checkbox is unchecked, the decay preset dropdown is disabled, and when checked, it's enabled. The formation dropdown is visible and can be changed when Starting XI is enabled. The team and referee dropdowns are also present and functional. The interface handles empty database gracefully by showing the appropriate UI elements even when no data is available. All the required API endpoints (/api/formations, /api/time-decay/presets, /api/teams, /api/referees) are now being called correctly, and the UI is responding appropriately to user interactions."

    message: "I've successfully tested the database management functionality. The GET /api/database/stats endpoint correctly returns collection statistics including total document count and per-collection counts. The DELETE /api/database/wipe endpoint properly clears all collections and returns success confirmation with stats. Both endpoints are accessible and working correctly. I found and fixed a bug in the database stats endpoint where datetime.datetime.now() was incorrectly referenced (changed to datetime.now()). The same issue was present in the database wipe endpoint, which I also fixed. After these fixes, both endpoints are working properly."

    message: "I've tested the Database Management UI in the Dashboard tab. The section is properly displayed with warning colors (red/orange theme) as required. The database statistics are displayed correctly in a grid layout showing Total Records, Matches, Team Stats, and Player Stats. The 'Refresh Stats' button works correctly and fetches the latest database statistics from the backend. The 'Wipe Database' button is present in the Danger Zone section with proper styling. The confirmation flow for database wipe includes multiple confirmations as required - first a warning dialog listing all data that will be deleted, then a final warning dialog, and finally a prompt asking the user to type 'DELETE' to confirm. The button also shows a loading state when processing. The UI is well-integrated with the existing Dashboard layout and the stats grid is responsive."

    message: "I've tested the Upload Data tab functionality and found a critical issue with the file upload feature. The UI components are correctly implemented with three upload sections (Match Data, Team Stats, Player Stats), file input controls that accept .csv files, and proper styling. However, all file uploads fail with 404 errors. The issue is a mismatch between frontend API calls and backend endpoints. In the frontend, the handleFileUpload function makes requests to '${API}/upload-${datasetType}' (e.g., '/api/upload-matches'), but the backend endpoints are defined as '/upload/matches', '/upload/team-stats', and '/upload/player-stats'. This path mismatch causes all upload attempts to fail. The 'Uploaded Datasets' section does not appear after uploads since they all fail. To fix this issue, either the frontend API calls need to be updated to use the correct paths or the backend endpoints need to be modified to match the frontend's expected paths."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "I've fixed and retested the Upload Data tab functionality. The issue was in the handleFileUpload function where the API endpoint path was incorrectly formatted. I changed it from '${API}/upload-${datasetType}' to '${API}/upload/${datasetType}' to match the backend endpoints. After this fix, all three upload sections (Match Data, Team Stats, Player Stats) now work correctly. Files can be selected and uploaded successfully, with proper status messages displayed after upload. The file input controls correctly accept .csv files and show the selected filenames. The only minor issue is that the 'Uploaded Datasets' section doesn't appear after successful uploads, which might be due to the datasets endpoint returning a 405 Method Not Allowed error. However, this doesn't affect the core upload functionality, which is working as expected. All upload endpoints now return 200 status codes and success messages."

    message: "I've verified that the uploaded data is correctly reflected in the Dashboard statistics. After uploading test files, the database statistics show 15550 Total Records, 522 Matches, 944 Team Stats, and 14084 Player Stats. This confirms that the file upload functionality is working correctly and the data is being properly stored in the database. The only remaining minor issue is that the 'Uploaded Datasets' section doesn't appear in the Upload Data tab, but this doesn't affect the core functionality. Overall, the Upload Data tab is now fully functional for its primary purpose of uploading match data, team stats, and player stats."

    message: "I've found and fixed a critical issue with the database accumulation behavior. The upload endpoints (/api/upload/matches, /api/upload/team-stats, /api/upload/player-stats) were replacing existing data instead of appending to it. Each endpoint was calling delete_many() on its respective collection before inserting new data, which was causing all previous data to be lost when new data was uploaded. I fixed this by removing the delete_many() calls from the upload endpoints. Now when data is uploaded, it is properly appended to the existing data rather than replacing it. I verified the fix by uploading multiple test datasets and confirming that the document counts increase with each upload."

    message: "I've successfully tested the ML model training functionality. The POST /api/train-ml-models endpoint correctly trains and saves the ML models, and the GET /api/ml-models/status endpoint correctly reports the status of the models. The training process works with the accumulated data, and the models are saved and can be loaded. The training results show good accuracy and RÂ² scores for the models. This confirms that the ML model training functionality is working as expected."

    message: "I've tested the fixed ML model training functionality in the Enhanced XGBoost tab. The model status section is displayed correctly and shows the XGBoost Models status as 'Ready'. The feature count is correctly displayed as 45 features, which meets the requirement of 45+ features. The 'Refresh Status' button works properly and makes successful API calls to /api/ml-models/status without any 404 errors. No console errors were detected during testing. The API endpoints for model status and training are working correctly. The UI components for model status display and training controls are properly implemented and functional."

    message: "I've tested the enhanced player search interface and Phase 2 time decay functionality. The Starting XI toggle button works correctly, allowing users to enable/disable the Starting XI functionality. When enabled, it changes the UI to show the formation selection dropdown and the 'Enhanced Predict with XI' button. The time decay checkbox and settings work as expected - when unchecked, the decay preset dropdown is disabled, and when checked, it's enabled. The decay preset dropdown shows all 5 required presets (aggressive, moderate, conservative, linear, none) with proper descriptions. The player search interface appears when teams are selected, but could not fully test the search functionality due to testing environment limitations. The interface is well-designed with proper visual feedback and responsive UI elements."

    message: "I've conducted comprehensive testing of the enhanced prediction functionality. The time decay presets (aggressive, moderate, conservative, linear, none) are correctly implemented and accessible through the API. All presets return successful predictions, though the time decay info is not included in the prediction breakdown. The NumPy serialization fix is partially working - all main numeric fields are properly serialized as Python native types, but some nested fields in the prediction breakdown still have non-serializable types. The ML model integration is working with 45 features, meeting the requirement of 45+ features. Feature importance information is correctly included in the prediction breakdown. The Starting XI functionality exists but could not be fully tested due to lack of player data in the database. The fallback mode for Starting XI is not working properly. Overall, the core enhanced prediction functionality is working, but there are some minor issues with the time decay info display and Starting XI fallback mode."

    message: "I've tested the Enhanced Predict button functionality in the Enhanced XGBoost tab. The button appears correctly when Starting XI mode is enabled, showing 'Enhanced Predict with XI' text. The button is properly disabled initially when no teams or referee are selected, which is the expected behavior. The time decay settings work correctly - when the checkbox is unchecked, the decay preset dropdown is disabled, and when checked, it's enabled. The button is visible and properly styled with a blue gradient background. However, I was unable to complete the full prediction workflow due to issues with selecting teams and referees in the testing environment - the dropdowns appear to have no selectable options, which is likely due to the test environment not having proper data loaded. Despite this limitation, the Enhanced Predict button itself is correctly implemented and follows the expected state management (disabled when form is incomplete)."
