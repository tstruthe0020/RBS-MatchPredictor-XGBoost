        comment: "Successfully tested the Starting XI and Time Decay functionality. The GET /api/formations endpoint correctly returns 5 available formations (4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, 4-5-1, 3-4-3). The GET /api/time-decay/presets endpoint correctly returns 5 decay presets (aggressive, moderate, conservative, linear, none) with proper descriptions. The GET /api/teams/{team_name}/players endpoint exists and responds correctly, though it returns empty results as expected since there are no teams/players in the database. The POST /api/predict-match-enhanced endpoint exists and responds correctly, though it cannot be fully tested without team data. The StartingXIManager and TimeDecayManager classes are properly initialized and integrated into the system."
