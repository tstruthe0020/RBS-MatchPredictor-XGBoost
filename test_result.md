The advanced stats like xg_per_shot, goals_per_xg, shot_accuracy, and conversion_rate are properly included and work correctly in regression analysis. Testing with advanced stats showed a much higher R² score (0.425) compared to basic stats (-0.013), indicating these derived metrics are more predictive of match outcomes."

        comment: "Successfully tested the new config suggestion endpoint. The endpoint correctly performs regression analysis on key statistics and generates meaningful configuration suggestions. The response includes R² score (0.422), sample size (758), and specific recommendations for adjusting weights based on statistical correlations. The suggestions are organized into categories (xg_calculation, adjustments) with explanations and confidence level. The endpoint provides actionable insights that can directly improve the match prediction algorithm's default configuration."

        comment: "Verified that field mapping issues have been partially resolved. The mapping code is correctly implemented in the server.py file with proper fallbacks and field mappings. The GET /api/team-performance/{team_name} endpoint now correctly maps 'fouls' to 'fouls_committed' and 'possession_pct' to 'possession_percentage', and calculates 'xg_difference' properly. The RBS calculation also uses these mapped fields correctly. However, testing revealed that the actual data for 'fouls_drawn' and 'penalties_awarded' is still zero for all teams, suggesting that while the mapping code is correct, the underlying data may be missing. This is likely due to the data import process rather than a code issue."

The aggregation logic correctly sums player stats per match and calculates per-match averages. However, there are still issues: 1) In RBS calculation, fouls_drawn values are zero in the stats breakdown despite being non-zero in team performance, 2) In regression analysis, fouls_drawn and penalties_awarded have zero coefficients.

RBS calculation now correctly includes non-zero values for fouls_drawn and penalties_awarded in the stats breakdown.

    message: "I've performed a final comprehensive verification of all xG and possession issues. All tests have passed successfully. The team performance data for Arsenal shows realistic xG values (1.59 home/1.68 away) and possession values (57.16% home/56.63% away). The xG difference values are different for home vs away games (0.84 home/0.71 away). RBS calculation correctly includes all 7 statistics with non-zero values for xG difference and meaningful possession percentage contributions. Data consistency checks confirm that xG values are properly aggregated from player stats, xG difference is correctly calculated as (team xG - opponent xG), and possession values come from the team_stats possession_pct column. Regression analysis shows that advanced statistics including xG-related metrics provide much better predictive power (R² = 0.425) compared to basic stats (R² = -0.006). All values are consistent across team performance and RBS endpoints. The system is now working correctly with realistic data values throughout."
