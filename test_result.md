        comment: "Successfully tested the RBS optimization analysis endpoint. The POST /api/analyze-rbs-optimization endpoint correctly analyzes all 7 RBS variables (yellow_cards, red_cards, fouls_committed, fouls_drawn, penalties_awarded, xg_difference, possession_percentage) and provides meaningful insights. The endpoint returns a comprehensive analysis including individual variable importance, correlations with match outcomes, and suggested weight adjustments based on statistical significance. The analysis correctly identifies xg_difference as the most significant predictor of match outcomes with a strong positive correlation (0.499), while yellow_cards, red_cards, and fouls_committed show negative correlations as expected. The endpoint also provides actionable recommendations for optimizing the RBS formula weights."
