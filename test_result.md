        comment: "Successfully tested the Standard Predict tab functionality. The tab displays correctly with a clear header and description. The prediction form includes all required fields: home team dropdown, away team dropdown, referee dropdown, and an optional match date field. All dropdowns are populated with the correct options. The Predict Match button is present and correctly styled, though it should be disabled when the form is empty but currently isn't. When teams and referee are selected, the button becomes clickable. The prediction workflow works correctly - after selecting teams and referee and clicking the Predict Match button, the prediction results are displayed with the expected score, win/draw/loss probabilities, and other relevant information. The New Prediction and Export PDF buttons are present and functional. The UI is well-designed with proper spacing and responsive layout."

        comment: "Successfully tested the Analysis tab functionality. The tab displays correctly with a clear header and description. The analysis dashboard layout is well-designed with three main sections: Regression Analysis, Referee Bias Study, and Model Optimization. Each section has a proper heading, description, and an action button. The Regression Analysis section explains statistical correlations between team performance metrics and match outcomes. The Referee Bias Study section explains calculating and analyzing referee bias scores. The Model Optimization section explains optimizing prediction algorithms and analyzing feature importance. All buttons are properly styled and positioned. The UI is responsive and maintains proper spacing and alignment on different screen sizes."

        comment: "Successfully tested the Config tab functionality. The tab displays correctly with a clear header and description. The configuration page is divided into three main sections: Time Decay Settings, Formation Settings, and System Status. The Time Decay Settings section includes a dropdown for selecting the default decay preset and a checkbox for enabling time decay by default. The Formation Settings section includes a dropdown for selecting the default formation and displays a list of available formations. The System Status section shows the XGBoost Models status (Loaded) and Data Status (30 teams, 50 referees). All form controls are functional and properly styled. The UI is responsive and maintains proper spacing and alignment on different screen sizes."

        comment: "Successfully tested the cross-tab functionality. Data consistency is maintained across tabs - the teams count (30) is consistent between the Dashboard and Config tabs. State management between tabs works correctly - settings changed in one tab (like time decay settings in the Enhanced XGBoost tab) are reflected in other tabs (like the Config tab). Navigation between tabs is smooth and maintains the application state. The UI remains responsive and well-designed across all tabs. No console errors were detected during tab navigation or state changes."

        comment: "Successfully tested error handling and edge cases. The application handles empty database gracefully by showing appropriate UI elements even when no data is available. Form validation works correctly in most cases - the Enhanced Predict button is disabled when required fields are empty, though the Standard Predict button should also be disabled but isn't. Error messages are user-friendly and clearly indicate what went wrong. Loading states are properly displayed during API calls, with spinner animations and appropriate text. The application provides good user feedback throughout the interaction flow. No console errors were detected during testing of various edge cases."
