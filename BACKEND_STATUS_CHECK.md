# Backend Status Check

## ‚úÖ **Good News: Your Backend is Almost Ready!**

The warning about "reload" is not critical - it just means hot reload is disabled when running the script directly.

## üîç **Check if Backend is Running:**

### Option 1: Test with Browser
Open this URL in your browser: **http://localhost:8001/docs**

If you see the FastAPI documentation page, your backend is working perfectly!

### Option 2: Test with Command Line
Open a **new terminal** (keep the backend running in the first one) and test:

```bash
# Test basic connection
curl http://localhost:8001/api/stats

# Or if curl isn't available on Windows:
# Open http://localhost:8001/api/stats in your browser
```

### Option 3: Test with PowerShell (Windows)
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8001/api/stats"
```

## ‚úÖ **Expected Results:**

**If Working:** You should see JSON data like:
```json
{"matches": 3515, "team_stats": 5552, "player_stats": 83862, "rbs_results": 0}
```

**If Not Working:** You'll see connection refused or timeout errors.

## üöÄ **Next Steps:**

### If Backend is Working:
1. **Keep backend running** in first terminal
2. **Open new terminal** for frontend:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\theos\RBS-MatchPredictor-XGBoost\frontend
   yarn install
   yarn start
   ```
3. **Access application** at http://localhost:3000

### If Backend Not Working:
Let me know what error you see when testing the URLs above.

## üìù **About the Reload Warning:**

The reload warning is cosmetic. To avoid it in future, you can also start the backend using:

```bash
# Alternative startup method (from backend directory):
uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
```

But for now, the `python server.py` method should work fine for development.

**Please test one of the URLs above to confirm the backend is responding!**
