## 📊 Poisson Distribution Simulation

### Step 1: XGBoost Goal Prediction
```python
# XGBoost predicts expected goals for each team
home_goals_predicted = home_goals_model.predict(features_scaled)[0]
away_goals_predicted = away_goals_model.predict(features_scaled)[0]

# Ensure positive values for Poisson parameters
home_lambda = max(0.1, home_goals_predicted)
away_lambda = max(0.1, away_goals_predicted)
```

### Step 2: Detailed Scoreline Probability Calculation
```python
def calculate_poisson_scoreline_probabilities(home_lambda, away_lambda, max_goals=6):
    scoreline_probs = {}
    home_win_prob = 0.0
    draw_prob = 0.0
    away_win_prob = 0.0
    
    # Calculate probabilities for each possible scoreline
    for home_goals in range(max_goals + 1):
        for away_goals in range(max_goals + 1):
            # Poisson probability for this exact scoreline
            prob = poisson.pmf(home_goals, home_lambda) * poisson.pmf(away_goals, away_lambda)
            scoreline = f"{home_goals}-{away_goals}"
            scoreline_probs[scoreline] = prob
            
            # Add to match outcome probabilities
            if home_goals > away_goals:
                home_win_prob += prob
            elif home_goals == away_goals:
                draw_prob += prob
            else:
                away_win_prob += prob
    
    return {
        'scoreline_probabilities': scoreline_probs,
        'match_outcome_probabilities': {
            'home_win': home_win_prob * 100,
            'draw': draw_prob * 100,
            'away_win': away_win_prob * 100
        },
        'most_likely_scoreline': max(scoreline_probs.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]),
        'poisson_parameters': {
            'home_lambda': home_lambda,
            'away_lambda': away_lambda
        }
    }
```

### Step 3: Enhanced Probability Normalization
```python
# Handle remaining probability for scores > max_goals
total_calculated = sum(scoreline_probs.values())
remaining_prob = max(0, 1 - total_calculated)

# Distribute remaining probability proportionally
if total_calculated > 0:
    home_win_prob += remaining_prob * (home_win_prob / total_calculated)
    draw_prob += remaining_prob * (draw_prob / total_calculated)  
    away_win_prob += remaining_prob * (away_win_prob / total_calculated)

# Final normalization to ensure sum = 100%
total_outcome_prob = home_win_prob + draw_prob + away_win_prob
if total_outcome_prob > 0:
    home_win_prob = (home_win_prob / total_outcome_prob) * 100
    draw_prob = (draw_prob / total_outcome_prob) * 100
    away_win_prob = (away_win_prob / total_outcome_prob) * 100
```

### Step 2: Possession Adjustment
**Formula:**
```python
possession_factor = 1 + (possession_pct - 50) × 0.01
adjusted_xg = base_xg × possession_factor
```

**Logic:**
- Teams with more possession get more attacking opportunities
- 60% possession = 1.1x multiplier
- 40% possession = 0.9x multiplier

**Example:**
```
Arsenal: 55% possession → factor = 1.05
Adjusted xG = 2.56 × 1.05 = 2.69
```

### Step 3: Fouls Drawn Adjustment
**Formula:**
```python
fouls_factor = 1 + (fouls_drawn - baseline) × fouls_multiplier
# baseline = 10 (league average)
# fouls_multiplier = 0.02 (configurable)
```

**Logic:**
- Teams that draw more fouls create more scoring opportunities
- Set pieces and penalty chances increase with fouls drawn

**Example:**
```
Arsenal: 12 fouls drawn/game → factor = 1 + (12-10) × 0.02 = 1.04
Adjusted xG = 2.69 × 1.04 = 2.80
```

### Step 4: Penalty Factor Addition
**Formula:**
```python
penalty_xg = penalties_per_game × penalty_xg_value × penalty_conversion_rate
# penalty_xg_value = 0.79 (historical average)
```

**Calculation:**
```python
penalty_xg = team_penalties_avg × 0.79 × team_penalty_conversion_rate
total_xg = adjusted_xg + penalty_xg
```

**Example:**
```
Arsenal: 0.15 penalties/game × 0.79 × 0.85 conversion = +0.10 xG
Total xG = 2.80 + 0.10 = 2.90
```

### Step 5: Team Quality (PPG) Adjustment
**Formula:**
```python
ppg_difference = home_team_ppg - away_team_ppg
ppg_adjustment = ppg_difference × 0.15
```

**Application:**
```python
home_xg += ppg_adjustment
away_xg -= ppg_adjustment
```

**Example:**
```
Arsenal PPG: 2.1, Chelsea PPG: 1.8
PPG difference: +0.3
Adjustment: 0.3 × 0.15 = +0.045 for Arsenal, -0.045 for Chelsea
```

### Step 6: Referee Bias Adjustment
**Formula:**
```python
referee_adjustment = rbs_score × 0.2
final_xg = total_xg + referee_adjustment
```

**Logic:**
- RBS (Referee Bias Score) ranges from -3 to +3
- Scaling factor of 0.2 converts to xG adjustment
- RBS of +2.5 = +0.5 xG boost

**Example:**
```
Arsenal with Referee Smith: RBS = +1.2
Referee adjustment = 1.2 × 0.2 = +0.24 xG
Final xG = 2.90 + 0.24 = 3.14
```

### Step 7: Goal Conversion
**Formula:**
```python
predicted_goals = final_xg × goals_per_xg_ratio
```

**goals_per_xg_ratio:**
- Historical efficiency: actual_goals ÷ xg_accumulated
- Accounts for clinical finishing vs. poor finishing teams

**Example:**
```
Arsenal goals/xG ratio: 1.15 (clinical finishers)
Predicted goals = 3.14 × 1.15 = 3.61 goals
```

### Step 8: Probability Calculation (Poisson Distribution)
**Formula:**
```python
# For each possible score combination (0-10 goals each)
prob_home_i_away_j = poisson(i, λ_home) × poisson(j, λ_away)

# Where λ = predicted goals for each team
home_win_prob = Σ prob(home > away)
draw_prob = Σ prob(home = away)  
away_win_prob = Σ prob(home < away)
```

**Implementation:**
```python
from scipy.stats import poisson

for home_goals in range(11):
    for away_goals in range(11):
        prob = poisson.pmf(home_goals, pred_home) * poisson.pmf(away_goals, pred_away)
        if home_goals > away_goals:
            home_win_prob += prob
        elif home_goals == away_goals:
            draw_prob += prob
        else:
            away_win_prob += prob
```
